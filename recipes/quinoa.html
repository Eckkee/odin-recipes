        <P><strong>Ready in 50 minutes:</strong> "Super easy to make, very healthy, high protein and definitely hits the spot. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare ground chicken. I'll be making this one often," says <em>France C.</em></P>
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced</li>
            <li>1.5 pounds ground chicken</li>
            <li>1 1/2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
          </ul>
  
      <h4> Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li></p>    
            <li><p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground chicken and break into small pieces while cooking until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.</li></p>
            <li><p>Stir cooked quinoa and diced tomatoes into the chicken mixture; bring to a simmer and cook long enough for the flavors to meld, about 10 minutes more.</li></p>
          </ol>
